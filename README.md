# Augmented Reality - Animal Farm
This project is for course COMP 494: Interactive Computer Graphics, Spring 2017. In this project, we aim to build a cross-platform mobile application that offers an augmented reality experience using Unity3D and Vuforia. This application uses image recognition and AR techniques to render 3D animals and let users interact with them.

# Installation
This project is built by Unity (64-bit). Make sure you have Unity on your local machine before cloning the app from Github.

To clone the project from Github, enter the following command into Terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/dletk/BookIt.git```

The open the project in Unity.

# Building the app to your devices
In order to build the app to your device (phone, tablet,...), connect your devices to your machine, and use the build system of Unity to deploy the app. For Android, this is pretty straightforward (on Mac, press `Command + B` and unity will automatically finish the building for you). For iPhone, Unity will generate an Xcode project for you, and you need to deploy that project to your phone by Xcode.

# How to use the app
Open the app in your device or hit "Play" button on Unity.

If you are using your phone, make sure the phone is in landscape mode before starting to point the camera at image targets.

If you are using Unity, hold the image targets in front of computer webcam. 

# App basic control instructions
